    <h1>Daily UI Challenge</h1>
    <h3>By Rachelle Patman</h3>
    <p>The <a href="http://www.dailyui.co/" target="_blank">Daily UI Challenge</a> is about sharpening my design skills, as well as increasing my design efficiency and practicing time
      management.</p>
    <p>Each challenge takes between 30 minutes and an hour, and is used as a warm up activity before the day begins.</p>
